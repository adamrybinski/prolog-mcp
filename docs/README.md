# Prolog-MCP Server: Neurosymbolic AI for Modern Workflows

## What is Neurosymbolic AI?

Neurosymbolic AI represents a convergence of **symbolic reasoning** (exemplified by Prolog's logic programming) and **neural networks'** pattern recognition capabilities. This hybrid approach addresses the limitations of each paradigm while leveraging their complementary strengths. For a deeper dive, see [this overview](https://dev.to/nucleoid/next-in-the-journey-neuro-symbolic-ai-2id9).

### Historical Foundations in Prolog

- **Symbolic AI roots:** Prolog, developed in the 1970s, became the cornerstone of symbolic AI with its rule-based inference engine and declarative knowledge representation. It enabled:
  - Logical deduction through Horn clauses
  - Expert systems for medical diagnosis and natural language processing
  - Precise reasoning with formal ontologies

- **Limitations of early symbolic systems:**
  - Struggled with uncertainty and real-world data
  - Required manual rule engineering
  - Lacked learning capabilities

### Modern Neural Integration

Current neurosymbolic systems combine Prolog-style reasoning with deep learning:

1. **Architecture patterns:**
   - Neural frontends process raw data (images/text)
   - Symbolic backends apply logical constraints
   - Bidirectional knowledge flow through shared embeddings

2. **Prolog's evolving role:**
   - **Logic-as-a-service:** Embedded Prolog engines validate neural outputs
   - **Dynamic knowledge graphs:** Prolog rules guide neural attention mechanisms
   - **Explainability layer:** Translates neural activations to human-readable proofs

3. **Toolchain integration:**
   ```prolog
   % Example: Hybrid image recognition
   detect(X) :- 
       neural_classifier(X, Class), 
       symbolic_constraint(Class, Context),
       validate(Class, Context).
   ```

#### Inductive Logic Programming (Progol) vs Neural Approaches

| **Aspect**          | **Progol/ILP**                          | **Neural Networks**               | **Neuro-symbolic Bridge**                |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Learning Paradigm** | Rule induction from examples + BK       | Statistical pattern recognition   | Systems like Propper combine ILP with neural-based BK processing |
| **Strengths**         | Interpretable rules, small data efficiency | Handles unstructured data, scalability | Neural-symbolic layers translate features to predicates |
| **Weaknesses**        | Sensitive to noise, limited scalability  | Black-box decisions, data hunger  | Symbolic regularizers shape neural training |
| **Integration**       | -                                       | -                                 | Joint inference and alternate neural/logical passes |

This synthesis enables systems that learn from both data samples and formal knowledge, achieving better generalization than either approach alone. Modern frameworks like Logical Neural Networks (LNN) demonstrate how gradient-based learning can coexist with precise logical semantics.

## Introducing Prolog-MCP

The **Prolog-MCP Server** is a neurosymbolic AI backend that brings together Prolog's symbolic reasoning and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It leverages the high-performance [Trealla Prolog](https://github.com/trealla-prolog/trealla) engine via [trealla-js](https://github.com/guregu/trealla-js) JavaScript/TypeScript bindings (npm: `trealla`).

### What is Prolog-MCP?

Prolog-MCP acts as a modular MCP server, exposing Prolog’s logic programming as a set of tools that can be orchestrated by LLMs, IDEs, or agentic workflows. It is ideal for:
- Validating LLM outputs with symbolic rules
- Stateful, explainable knowledge bases
- Hybrid AI pipelines combining neural and symbolic reasoning

---

## Key Features

- **Persistent Prolog Sessions:** Maintain state and context between tool calls, supporting complex multi-step reasoning.
- **Session Management:** Save and load knowledge bases to disk for long-running or collaborative projects.
- **Four Core Tools:**
  - `loadProgram`: Dynamically load Prolog predicates/rules.
  - `runPrologQuery`: Execute logical queries and retrieve all solutions.
  - `saveSession`: Persist the entire Prolog state to disk.
  - `loadSession`: Restore a previous session instantly.
- **Type Safety:** All I/O is validated using Zod schemas.
- **WebAssembly Runtime:** Runs Trealla Prolog in a WASI environment for speed and portability.
- **Modern Integration:** Easily connect with Cline, Roo, Copilot, and other MCP-compatible tools.

---

## How It Works

The server uses [trealla-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/trealla) to embed Trealla Prolog as a high-performance WASM interpreter in Node.js and browser environments. Each MCP tool call (such as `runPrologQuery`) is mapped to a persistent Prolog interpreter instance, ensuring context is maintained across queries.

---

## Integration Example

Plug into Cline, Roo, Copilot for neurosymbolic LLM development or any MCP-compatible host for production LLM-Prolog neurosymbolic integration with this config:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prolog-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "prolog-mcp/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "disabled": false,
      "alwaysAllow": [
        "loadProgram",
        "runPrologQuery",
        "saveSession",
        "loadSession"
      ],
      "timeout": 15
    }
  }
}
```

This enables symbolic reasoning in your AI workflows with a single configuration step.

## Example Use Case

*Validate medical safety rules with Prolog:*

```prolog
?- loadProgram("
  safe_dosage(Drug, Patient) :-
    patient_weight(Patient, W),
    max_daily(Drug, Max),
    current_dosage(Drug, D),
    D =< Max * W.
").
?- runPrologQuery("safe_dosage(warfarin, patient_123)").
```

## Serverless and Kubernetes Integration

Prolog-MCP is designed for efficient deployment in modern serverless and cloud-native environments, thanks to its WASI-compatible WebAssembly runtime.

**Fermyon Spin Integration:**  
You can deploy Prolog-MCP as a near-server function using Fermyon Spin. This enables ultra-fast, event-driven logic execution at the edge or in microservices architectures.

**KubeSpin and Kubernetes WASI Controller:**  
For large-scale or enterprise deployments, Prolog-MCP can be managed using KubeSpin or any Kubernetes WASI controller. This allows you to run hundreds of lightweight, isolated Prolog-MCP instances per cluster node, with rapid cold starts and strong sandboxing.

**Benefits:**
- Near-instant cold start (<50ms)
- High density (many instances per node)
- Security via WASI sandboxing
- Seamless integration into event-driven and microservices platforms

---

## Why Trealla and trealla-js?

- **Trealla Prolog** is a fast, lean ISO Prolog interpreter targeting WASI, ideal for both serverless and embedded scenarios.
- **trealla-js** provides robust JavaScript/TypeScript bindings, making it easy to embed Prolog logic in Node.js or browser-based MCP servers.
- This combination ensures high performance, portability, and easy integration with modern developer tools.

---

## MCP Architecture: Modular and Extensible

MCP (Model Context Protocol) defines a clear separation between hosts (IDEs, LLMs), clients, servers, and data sources. Prolog-MCP fits into this architecture as a lightweight, tool-focused server, exposing symbolic reasoning to any AI host via a simple, standardized protocol.
